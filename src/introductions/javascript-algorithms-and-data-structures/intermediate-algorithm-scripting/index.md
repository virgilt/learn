## Introduction to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges

In this section we will learn to solve intermediate algorithms using JavaScript.

Remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.

Hint
Break each problem down into steps and manually write them on a white board or piece of paper. This technique will allow you to think clearly about the problem and make sure you do not skip any steps.
